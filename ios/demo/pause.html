    <h1>debug mode</h1>
    <div>
        To debug your embedded html from the start, open Safari now, and choose
        Develop -> Simulator (or device) -> <span><script>document.write(String(window.location).replace(/^.*[\\\/]/, ''))</script></span> and the name of the file.  Then click on
        the link below.  That will allow you to check if some assets are not found, &amp;c.  If you don't have the develop menu, then you need to enable it.
    </div>
